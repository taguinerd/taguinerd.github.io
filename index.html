    <h1> Welcome to Allen Taguinod's Page! </h1>
    <p> I'm Allen and I'm currently an intern for A Better Consultancy (ABC) based in Singapore.</p>
    <p> I am currently finishing my Diploma in Infocomm Technology from PSB Academy. However, I have already completed a degree programme from another field. I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Psychology (HONS.) from Coventry University. </p>
    <p> My IT Diploma serves as my introduction to this vast industry, but I have already been long exposed to it by virtue of both my parents working in IT. Furthermore, I have always held a great interest in technology, thus learning more about IT through this internship is a great opportunity for me. </p>
